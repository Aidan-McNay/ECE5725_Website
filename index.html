      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
              When you use a vending machine, the interface is usually fairly straight-forward; 
              you enter what you'd like, and the machine deposits it. While this is relatively
              simple for the user, it doesn't leave much room for adaptability on the producer's
              end. If a product suddenly becomes popular, the owner has no way to capitalize on
              this increasing demand. Likewise, if a product becomes unpopular, the owner has no
              way to increase the incentive for consumers to purchase it by lowering the price.
              While owners could go around and manually modify the price in-person, this doesn't scale well
              for large systems of machines.<br><br>
              To address this issue, we propose the Desperation Machine 2.0 (named due to an inside 
              joke resulting in the vending machines in the basement of Upson Hall being christened
              the "Desperation Machine"). In addition to serving as a fully functional vending machine,
              the Desperation Machine 2.0 introduces a web interface that allows an owner to monitor
              their machines from a distance. This not only allows the owner to manually change prices,
              but to define rules as to how the machines can automatically change their prices based on
              their current stock of an item, as well as how often the item is purchased.

        <h5>Figure 1: Overall Desperation Machine 2.0 Dimensions</h5>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align:center;">
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">One of the first tasks that was completed was the overall dimensioning of the vending
           machine. We knew the approximate size that we wanted just from general experience, but
           having concrete dimensions would help a lot down the road when constructing, as we
           wouldn't have to focus on design and implementation at the same time.<br><br>
           From measuring vending machines nearby to the lab (such as the original Desperation
           Machine, as well as the vending machines on the third floor of Phillips Hall), we
           determined that each channel should be at least 4 inches wide; rounding up for extra
           room left us with a width of 1 foot. Additionally, each channel should be 7 inches; with
           2 channels, as well as the ramp at the bottom (about 4 inches tall, to have a substantial
           slope) left us with a 1.5 foot high machine. Finally, we estimated that we'd need about a
           foot for the overall storage; combined with the front area for the slope (about 6 inches)
           and room in the back for our electronics, we ended up with a depth of 2 feet.<br><br>
           Finally, we included a separate housing for our PiTFT. While this ended up not being implemented
           due to time constraints, it still helped to visualize our PiTFT as separate, forcing us to define
           the interface between the vending machine and processor concretely.

        <h5>Figure 2: Schematic of the Motor Controller Board</h5>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align:center;">
        <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
          The other main drawing that we constructed was the schematic for our Motor Controller board, 
          which hosts our 2 TB6612FNG Motor Controllers. 
          This board serves as the main interface between the Raspberry Pi GPIO's and the motors that spin
          the vending machine coils to dispense product. Here, we connected all of the inputs from GPIO's to
          the needed inputs for the motor drivers (PWM signals and two binary input signals for each motor, with
          each motor driver being capable of controlling two motors). We then connect the analog outputs to the
          motors. Each of the GPIO inputs has a current-limiting resistor on it, to prevent any short-circuit
          current from destroying the Raspberry Pi. In terms of power, we have V<sub>cc</sub> tied to the 3.3V
          coming from the Raspberry Pi, and V<sub>m</sub> (our higher voltage for the motors) coming from the
          4 AA batteries in series (generating 6V, same as the setup from Lab 3 and the one suggested by Adafruit 
          - see <a href="#references">References</a>). Lastly, we tie the standby (STBY) pin high, so as to keep 
          the motor drivers engaged (see <a href="#references">References</a>). By determining this schematic early,
          it allowed us to figure out the overall design before implementation, allowing us to only have to focus on
          one at a time.

    <hr id='testing'>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Testing</h2>
              <h4>Hardware</h4>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
              For our hardware testing, our goal was fairly straightforward; make sure that the coils could
              output the product. To do this, we developed a Python file <span style="font-family: Courier New">dispense.py</span>
              to house our code's interface to the machine. Inside this file, we defined the GPIO's for each of
              the signals to the motors, and based the rest of the code off of that. This allowed us to easily
              modify our wiring with little change to the code; in fact, we discovered that our initial wiring
              had GPIO's that were set to default high, meaning that the motor span by default even when the code
              hadn't been run. Utilizing this agile approach allowed us to quickly swap the wiring; while our current
              wiring uses the debug pins (active-high on boot, meaning that the motor spins for a second when we first
              turn our system on), these pins can be turned off subsequently when booting up by disabling debug, allowing
              our system to be idle by default.<br><br>
              In <span style="font-family: Courier New">dispense.py</span>, we define a few helper functions to
              initialize and cleanup our GPIO's. However, the first standalone function is <span style="font-family: Courier New">motor_test</span>.
              This function tests each motor one by one, waiting for user input to progress to the next. This provided
              us with a clean way to test all of our motor's functionality at once, and quickly identify and remedy
              any initial issues (such as swapped wires). Once we'd verified the initial functionality, we could then
              test our main application with the <span style="font-family: Courier New">dispense</span> function. This
              function took in a slot location (any of <span style="font-family: Courier New">tr, tl, br, bl</span>, 
              corresponding to top vs. bottom and left vs. right), and dispensed a product from that location. The
              actuation of motors was kept separate; while we could have re-used code by changing the pins that were
              actuated when the function was called, we decided we'd rather separate the instances to have custom amounts
              of time that each motor was on to dispense, allowing us to observe the motors working and correct for variation
              in construction. While the <span style="font-family: Courier New">dispense</span> function was very helpful
              for testing, it also provided a clean interface between the software and hardware, defining the contract
              between then (similar to an ISA) through the function.
