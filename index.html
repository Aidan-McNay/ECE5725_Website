      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        When you use a vending machine, the interface is usually fairly straight-forward;
        you enter what you'd like, and the machine deposits it. While this is relatively
        simple for the user, it doesn't leave much room for adaptability on the producer's
        end. If a product suddenly becomes popular, the owner has no way to capitalize on
        this increasing demand. Likewise, if a product becomes unpopular, the owner has no
        way to increase the incentive for consumers to purchase it by lowering the price.
        While owners could go around and manually modify the price in-person, this doesn't scale well
        for large systems of machines.<br><br>
        To address this issue, we propose the Desperation Machine 2.0 (named due to an inside
        joke resulting in the vending machines in the basement of Upson Hall being christened
        the "Desperation Machine"). In addition to serving as a fully functional vending machine,
        the Desperation Machine 2.0 introduces a web interface that allows an owner to monitor
        their machines from a distance. This not only allows the owner to manually change prices,
        but to define rules as to how the machines can automatically change their prices based on
        their current stock of an item, as well as how often the item is purchased.

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <h4>Hardware</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        The hardware of the vending machine was constructed out of plywood, with varying thicknesses across the project
        (thicker for the frame, thinner for the internal components). While previous projects similar to this have used
        cardboard instead, we felt that plywood would make our structure more rigid and concrete, while still being
        easily manufacturable with the use of the table saw and laser cutter available in the adjacent lab space.
        Vending machines typically use rotating coils to dispense products; for these, we used coat hangers bent into
        a helical shape, which provided enough rigidity to move the products. These were actuated by 4 of the DC motors
        (controlled by 2 motor controllers) from Lab 2. These were connected to the GPIO's of our Raspberry Pi (through
        current-limiting resistors in series), allowing our processor to fully control the operation of the vending
        machine.
      </p>
      <h4>Software</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        The software of the vending machie was based around a Flask API server, which worked really well. I used the
        Jinja2 templating engine. The web interface consisted of several pages. The first was a login and registration
        page, used to sign up new users. Additionally, we had a balance page, where people could add funds to their
        vending machine debit accounts. We also had an item management page, which included a table of items in the
        vending machine, and allowed administrators to change the prices and see purchase history for each item in the
        machine. This allowed users to manage prices based on sale history. Finally, there was a "dispense" page,
        intended to be displayed on the vending machine, which allowed a user to select a product and dispense it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        To store the data for vending machine, we used a SQLite database. The database included a users table, which
        stored login information for each user (hashed and salted with the bcrypt algorithm), as well as account
        balances, stored in cents, to prevent floating point errors in currency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        Finally, to run the vending machine, we used a systemd service. This allows for complex restart rules in the
        event that the vending machine loses power or experiences a software failure.
      </p>

      <h2>Drawings</h2>
      <img class="img-rounded" src="pics/dims.png" alt="Vending Machine Dimensions" width="500" height="365">
      <h5>Figure 1: Overall Desperation Machine 2.0 Dimensions</h5>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">One of the first tasks that was completed was the overall
        dimensioning of the vending
        machine. We knew the approximate size that we wanted just from general experience, but
        having concrete dimensions would help a lot down the road when constructing, as we
        wouldn't have to focus on design and implementation at the same time.<br><br>
        From measuring vending machines nearby to the lab (such as the original Desperation
        Machine, as well as the vending machines on the third floor of Phillips Hall), we
        determined that each channel should be at least 4 inches wide; rounding up for extra
        room left us with a width of 1 foot. Additionally, each channel should be 7 inches; with
        2 channels, as well as the ramp at the bottom (about 4 inches tall, to have a substantial
        slope) left us with a 1.5 foot high machine. Finally, we estimated that we'd need about a
        foot for the overall storage; combined with the front area for the slope (about 6 inches)
        and room in the back for our electronics, we ended up with a depth of 2 feet.<br><br>
        Finally, we included a separate housing for our PiTFT. While this ended up not being implemented
        due to time constraints, it still helped to visualize our PiTFT as separate, forcing us to define
        the interface between the vending machine and processor concretely.

    </div>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        The other main drawing that we constructed was the schematic for our Motor Controller board,
        which hosts our 2 TB6612FNG Motor Controllers.
        This board serves as the main interface between the Raspberry Pi GPIO's and the motors that spin
        the vending machine coils to dispense product. Here, we connected all of the inputs from GPIO's to
        the needed inputs for the motor drivers (PWM signals and two binary input signals for each motor, with
        each motor driver being capable of controlling two motors). We then connect the analog outputs to the
        motors. Each of the GPIO inputs has a current-limiting resistor on it, to prevent any short-circuit
        current from destroying the Raspberry Pi. In terms of power, we have V<sub>cc</sub> tied to the 3.3V
        coming from the Raspberry Pi, and V<sub>m</sub> (our higher voltage for the motors) coming from the
        4 AA batteries in series (generating 6V, same as the setup from Lab 3 and the one suggested by Adafruit
        - see <a href="#references">References</a>). Lastly, we tie the standby (STBY) pin high, so as to keep
        the motor drivers engaged (see <a href="#references">References</a>). By determining this schematic early,
        it allowed us to figure out the overall design before implementation, allowing us to only have to focus on
        one at a time.

    <hr id='testing'>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <h4>Software</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        For software testing, the goal was to ensure robustness of the database and login systems, and verify that edge
        and corner cases were handled properly, such as in the event that a product is out of stock, or that the user
        has insufficient funds. In each of these cases, the user is presented with an error screen explaining the issue,
        and giving them an opportuity to try again.
      </p>
      <h4>Hardware</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        For our hardware testing, our goal was fairly straightforward; make sure that the coils could
        output the product. To do this, we developed a Python file <span
          style="font-family: Courier New">dispense.py</span>
        to house our code's interface to the machine. Inside this file, we defined the GPIO's for each of
        the signals to the motors, and based the rest of the code off of that. This allowed us to easily
        modify our wiring with little change to the code; in fact, we discovered that our initial wiring
        had GPIO's that were set to default high, meaning that the motor span by default even when the code
        hadn't been run. Utilizing this agile approach allowed us to quickly swap the wiring; while our current
        wiring uses the debug pins (active-high on boot, meaning that the motor spins for a second when we first
        turn our system on), these pins can be turned off subsequently when booting up by disabling debug, allowing
        our system to be idle by default.<br><br>
        In <span style="font-family: Courier New">dispense.py</span>, we define a few helper functions to
        initialize and cleanup our GPIO's. However, the first standalone function is <span
          style="font-family: Courier New">motor_test</span>.
        This function tests each motor one by one, waiting for user input to progress to the next. This provided
        us with a clean way to test all of our motor's functionality at once, and quickly identify and remedy
        any initial issues (such as swapped wires). Once we'd verified the initial functionality, we could then
        test our main application with the <span style="font-family: Courier New">dispense</span> function. This
        function took in a slot location (any of <span style="font-family: Courier New">tr, tl, br, bl</span>,
        corresponding to top vs. bottom and left vs. right), and dispensed a product from that location. The
        actuation of motors was kept separate; while we could have re-used code by changing the pins that were
        actuated when the function was called, we decided we'd rather separate the instances to have custom amounts
        of time that each motor was on to dispense, allowing us to observe the motors working and correct for variation
        in construction. While the <span style="font-family: Courier New">dispense</span> function was very helpful
        for testing, it also provided a clean interface between the software and hardware, defining the contract
        between then (similar to an ISA) through the function.
      </p>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <h2>Issues</h2>
      <h4>Software</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        I ran into two issues with the software of the project. The first was handling currency with floating point
        numbers. Often, I would perfom an addition or subtraction, and the result would be off by several
        thousanths. I fixed this problem by storing currency as an integer number of cents, so that arithmetic would be
        exact. The other issue that I ran into was the PiTFT display being to small to show the interface for the
        vending machine. We fixed this by allowing the user to perfom dispense operations on a personal device, such as
        their phone or personal computer. This also has the added benefit of being safer in the era of the COVID-19
        pandemic.
      </p>

      <h4>Hardware</h4>
      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        The first major issue with hardware was the warping of the wood. Given that plywood has different layers,
        differences
        in the layers, specifically when exposed to moisture, will cause the layers to expand unevenly and the wood to
        warp
        (hence why the wood was shipped with silica gel - to absorb any moisture). This caused issues with our overall
        construction;
        we couldn't rely on our sheets to be completely flat, meaning that they may not lie well with others. This led
        to many struggles
        getting the wood to bend how we wanted, but through the use of many clamps and interpretation of items around
        the lab as
        weights, we got the main components to interface well. Note that this was particularly important (and difficult)
        for the overall
        frame; this not only composed the main structure, but was some of the larger pieces of wood.<br><br>

        Another issue, although not as significant, was the GPIO's used to control the motors. When experimenting, we
        realized that one
        motor in particular would always start spinning on boot, and wouldn't stop until we ran our code to manually
        overwrite the GPIO
        value. Looking into this, we discovered that the GPIO's had different default states, given by the internal
        pull-up or pull-down
        resistors (see the ARM Peripherals in the <a href="#references">References</a>). However, we couldn't have all
        GPIO's that
        defaulted to low, as we didn't have enough GPIO's on the Raspberry Pi to do so. As a compromise between these,
        we chose to use
        the pins that are normally reserved for UART debugging (physical pins 8 and 10, GPIO's 14 and 15). While this
        did mean that
        the motor would be on temporarily during boot, by disabling the debugging functionality with the
        <span style="font-family: Courier New">sudo raspi-config</span> command, we could make it so that the debug (and
        initial value
        of high) was turned off during boot, meaning that the motor only spun for a couple seconds during this period,
        and remained off
        even before code was run. While this might be seen as a bug, in real-life applications, our system would remain
        on for long periods
        of time, only turning off during service, making this bug not very impactful<br><br>

        Lastly, an issue that hardware found during application testing was with the strength of the motors. While our
        small DC motors are
        good for small applications, they lack the ability to give high torque. This lead to stalling with irregular
        coils (necessitating
        reshaping to become more helical - they were done by hand, leading to irregularities), but also when trying to
        drive larger products,
        including Welch's Fruit Snacks and CLIF bars. However, we could still have a successful functioning prototype by
        switching to lighter
        products that the motors could handle, including Nutri-Grain bars, granola bars, chips, pretzels, and graham
        crackers. Given that
        this system is only meant to be a prototype, and that it can still demonstrate functionality, this issue isn't
        huge; however, a final
        version would need to have stronger motors (or mechanical assist through gearing ratios) to be able to dispense
        a wide range of
        products.

      <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
        Overall, our product turned out really well! While we weren't able to implement everything our project initially
        set out to do (such as have separate housing for the Raspberry Pi, or have self-updating rules), our
        proof-of-concept
        had enough detail and functionality to still be a large success. Further projects may look to expand by
        implementing
        the things that we didn't, or by exploring ways to increase the motor drive capability (such as through a
        driving
        mechanism with a high gear ratio) such that larger products could be vended. The nice thing is that much of our
        framework
        could be re-used for this; the Raspberry Pi connections could be fed into something else, the rule updates could
        be
        worked into the code, and the motors could be taken out (as they are screwed in and replacable) to substitute
        for
        a new mechanism. While we don't think our product is quite ready for the shelves just yet (especially given that
        users
        could currently just take the snacks from the front &#128517;), it certainly demonstrates that such a product is
        viable.
